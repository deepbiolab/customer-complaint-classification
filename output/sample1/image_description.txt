The image provided visually depicts several issues related to the customer's complaint about their smartwatch not effectively syncing with their smartphone, along with app crashes and inaccurate step tracking.

1. **Smartwatch and Phone Not Syncing**: The most prominent visual representation is how the smartwatch and the phone are not synchronized. This can be inferred through independent and detached displays highlighted on both devices. The phone is depicted on the right side of the image [0.7, 0.5], while the smartwatch is to the left [0.3, 0.5], oriented towards the phone, indicating an attempt to interact or sync.

2. **App Crashes**: The smartphone’s screen displays a big question mark [0.7, 0.5] with electrical bolt images around an icon that resembles a shoe, which might represent a walking tracker or exercise app. This image element suggests confusion or problems concerning the app's functionality, which echoes the customer's issue regarding the app instability and crashes.

3. **Inaccurate Step Tracking**: The shoe icon within the smartphone screen [0.7, 0.5], surrounded by what looks like an error alert (electrical bolts), supports the customer’s specific complaint about inaccurate step tracking. The flash or alert around the shoe is a typical illustrative method to denote malfunction or problematic areas.

4. **Resetting Fails to Fix Issue**: The watch face shows an alert icon and a displeased expression [0.3, 0.5] which could indicate that despite attempts to fix (possibly through resets as mentioned in the complaint), the problem persists. This underscores the customer's frustration over repeated resets not resolving the syncing and tracking problems.

Each of these visual elements in the image correlate directly with the problems described in the customer's complaint, illustrating shortcomings in device functionality, app performance, and syncing capabilities.
