From analyzing the image, which showcases two board games in separate boxes, both games appear highly organized and properly packaged at first glance. However, focusing on the issue mentioned in the complaint regarding missing key pieces, the following observations can be made:

1. **Chess Set Board**: The chess set, on the right side of the image, appears to include an array of standard chess pieces arranged in their slots. Closer inspection of this particular game does not indicate any missing pieces. The chess pieces are positioned in the box such that all typical pieces (pawn, rook, knight, bishop, queen, and king) are visible, and there appears to be a sufficient quantity of each for standard gameplay.

2. **"Chibie Stampie" Board Game**: The game on the left, titled "Chibie Stampie," which is a colorful and cartoony-style board game, does not visibly show missing components from the overview. However, without knowing the exact inventory list for this game, it is challenging to verify if any specific components necessary to play the game are actually missing solely from the image. From what is visible, cards, playing pieces, and various game tokens seem to be in place.

**Approximate Coordinates**: 
- Chess set is located roughly between [x: 0.5, y: 0] and [x: 1, y: 0.5], occupying the top right quadrant of the image.
- Chibie Stampie board game is approximately located between [x: 0, y:0] and [x: 0.5, y: 0.5], filling the top left quadrant.

Given the complaint, it might be that the individual games are complete but were erroneously reported as missing key pieces due to a misunderstanding of the contents. Alternatively, if there is a specific enumeration of what should be included with "Chibie Stampie" not visible in the image, this could account for the noted discrepancy. Verification via a detailed content list compared against what is depicted would be required to thoroughly address the complaint. Note that from the image alone, no specific missing game components can be conclusively identified within the visual frame provided.
