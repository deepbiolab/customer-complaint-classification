The image distinctly illustrates several concerns raised in the customer's complaint regarding the face cream. The two primary elements central to the complaint are:

1. **Broken Seal**:
   - There is a visible piece of what appears to be the cream's seal at the bottom right of the image. The broken fragment is positioned at approximately [0.85, 0.7] using the coordinate system described (where [0, 0] is the top-left corner and [1, 1] is the bottom-right corner).
   - This clearly aligns with the customer's complaint about the product's seal being broken upon arrival.

2. **Product Usage Indication**:
   - The cream within the container is depicted with a prominent swirl or scoop taken from it, positioned directly in the center of the image. The scoop gives the appearance that the product has been used, as typical new face cream products are smooth and undisturbed on the surface.
   - The location of the disturbed cream in the container is at [0.5, 0.5] on the described coordinate scale.

These elements visually substantiate the customerâ€™s complaint about receiving a face cream with a broken seal and an appearance of being previously used. Given the nature of skincare products, where hygiene and integrity of the product are paramount, this situation as depicted in the image indeed highlights a valid concern that warrants a request for a replacement or a refund.
