In addressing the customer's complaint regarding the erroneous delivery of dog food, the following key objects in the image directly relate to the issue outlined:

1. **Delivery Receipt**:
   - **Located** at [0.1, 0.1] to [0.4, 0.9].
   - The delivery receipt shown in the image might list details such as the quantity or weight of the dog food ordered. If accurate details are mentioned here, they could corroborate the customer's claim of having ordered a 10 kilograms package.

2. **Dog Food Package**:
   - **Located** at [0.55, 0.45] to [0.75, 0.95].
   - The visible packaging of the dog food clearly indicates that it is a 5-kilogram bag, as noted by the prominent "5" on the front of the sack. This is central to the customer's complaint as it visually confirms the discrepancy between the ordered and delivered quantity.

3. **Additional Visual Elements**:
   - **Dog food image in the thought bubble** and **on the package**.
   - While these elements are less critical, they also emphasize the product involved in this complaint, ensuring there is no ambiguity about the type of product incorrectly delivered.

By examining these elements, it is clear that the received package, being only 5 kilograms, does not match the 10 kilograms stated in the complaint. This visual evidence supports the customer's claim and highlights the need for immediate action to address and rectify the quantity discrepancy in the delivery.
