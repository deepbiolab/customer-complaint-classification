Category: Garden & Outdoor
Subcategory: Grills & Outdoor Cooking
Confidence: high
Reasoning: The customer complaint specifically mentions issues with a grill, which directly falls under the 'Grills & Outdoor Cooking' subcategory within the 'Garden & Outdoor' main category. The description of the damage (dents and scratches) and the nature of the complaint (unacceptable condition for a new product) aligns perfectly with this classification.
