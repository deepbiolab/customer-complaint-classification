From the image provided and the context of your complaint regarding the condition of the grill, here are my observations:

1. **Dents on the Surface**: The grill displays multiple visible dents on its upper surface. These dents vary in size and are prominently scattered across the top. The most noticeable dents can be found approximately at the coordinates:
   - Large dent near the center: [0.45, 0.50]
   - Several smaller dents radiating outward from the center towards the edges.

2. **Scratches on the Surface**: There are distinct scratch marks on the surface of the grill. These scratches particularly stand out as they are lighter than the surrounding dark color of the grill. This contrasting appearance emphasizes the presence of damage. The main concentration of scratches is at:
   - Central upper area: [0.45, 0.50]

3. **General Condition of the Product**: From the visible damage, the grill indeed looks like it might have been previously used or, as suggested, handled poorly during transportation. The aesthetic aspect of the grill does not align with a new item expectation due to the physical imperfections clearly seen.

Since the customer complaint revolves around the condition of the delivered product not meeting the expected "new" quality, the mentioned dents and scratches visually validate the issues in the complaint. These findings substantiate concerns regarding product handling and delivery standards. A replacement or refund would be reasonable steps for resolution based on the visible evidence of damage.
